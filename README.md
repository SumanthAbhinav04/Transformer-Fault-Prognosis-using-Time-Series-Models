# Transformer-Fault-Prognosis-using-Time-Series-Models
Built a vibration-based fault detection model for power transformers using a Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) architecture. Employed Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization and used a generator-based data pipeline with early stopping to ensure efficient and accurate training on time-series sensor data.
